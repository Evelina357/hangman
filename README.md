# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 


**Instalation instructions:** Open the files ending with .py and run the code as you would normally run Python code. 


**Usage instructions:** The compute picks a random word (from a hidden list of words) and then asks for a user to guess a letter that could contain in the computer picked word. The computer will inform the user of the picked letter is in the word or not. If the user enters an invalid input (containing a symbol not in alphabetical order or containing more than one letter), the computer will keep asking for the user to enter a valid input until one is received. 


**File structure of the project:** A hidden list from which computer picks a word and two functions 
check_guess(guess) and ask_for_input().
